        <h3>Feeling Confused?</h3>
        <div class="regtext">
          <p><strong>1. Focus on What You Know</strong></p>
          Take your mind off of what you're confused about. Think about the things you are sure about, and work from there.
          <p><strong>2. Do something else.</strong></p>
          If you're really confused about some math homework, take a break. Read a book, or scroll on your favorite social media platform for a while.
