        <h3>Feeling Stressed?</h3>
        <div class="regtext">
        <p><strong>1. Think about what made you stressed.</strong></p>
        If it was homework, maybe you should take a break. Is someone in your family making you stressed? Take some time for yourself away from them.
        <p><strong>2. Write down your goals.</strong></p>
        In a journal, write down everything you're looking forward to, or that you want to do. Focus on these goals, rather than what's making you stressed.
